Hello!

If you click "Gamemodes" at the top, you can see which gamemode is currently selected (it will have
a check next to it). You can change which gamemode you want to play next game by simply pressing one of these three menu
items. The new game type will start once you click "start". You will also see the title of the window change when you do
so.

When the game ends, the dialog boxes will tell the user how long it took for them to win/lose for all games except for "Speed
Demon", where time only matters as long as you click a new square every ten seconds.
